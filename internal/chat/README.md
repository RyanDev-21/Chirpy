I need to update the register method and need to implement the channel
connection between the user join the group and leave
and i need to do some handler for those join and leave which should hit the 
http request and then update the in-state-memory while the program running 
but i think i can send those upgrade data through the channel of that hub server


//chat and groups has to share the same db
maybe noSql
